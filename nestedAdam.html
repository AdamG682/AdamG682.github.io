                                            story for Andor, as what we received in Rogue One was quite limited. The reason that I am so excited for this series is that before any footage or even any trailers, it already got confirmed to have a second
                                            season, meaning that the writers must have incredible faith in the show.

                                            EA's separate Star Wars: The Old Republic MMO is ongoing, but Knights of the Old Republic's story-focused single-player RPG style was riveting nearly two decades ago and should stand the test of time when the
                                            remake is ready to launch.

                                    planets completing story missions that took place on said planet. As well as bringing back all the classic playable characters, they'll be adding the newer franchises to the game including Mando in his Beskar armor,
                                    classic character skins from the original games, and more.

                                    been more excited then now, and we don't even know what the show is going to be about! All that is confirmed at the moment of writting this is that Hayden Christenson is returning to portray Darth Vader and Ray park
                                    is going to return as Darth maul! We have seen 2 renditions of Darth Maul so far, the one from the prequels and the one from the Clone Wars TV show. So I'm very excited to see how angry this version is compared to the
                                    two as well as how angry Darth Vader will be. Ewan Mcgregor did make a statement recently saying that Vader is scarier than what we saw in Rogue One, and if you saw that movie, he was pretty mencaing.

                                    popular Star Wars began selling Official Cal Kestis lightsabers in Star Wars land at Disney parks. Not only do I hope to see a second game for the series but I would also love to see Cal Kestis in a live action role.
                                    Considering the person who plays Cal, Cameron Monaghen, is an actual actor who has been on hit shows like Shameless, I'm hopeful that it's an actual possibility.

                                    puts a personal touch to it. I'm not to familiar with the Rogue Squadron comics and books, but it's a whole movie about fighter pilots, so what more can you need. I always found the fighter pilot scenes in Star Wars
                                    to be the best. The trench run scene in the original movie is so well done for what they had at the time, and the newer pilot scenes just keep getting better. </p>
