                                            Quantic Dream and allows for players to express the story in a variety of

                                            for this project shows that it takes place during the High Republic era and
                                            will
                                            also allow for players to interact on a variety of planets, but also within
                                            outer space. This game
                                            reminds me of Knights of the Old Republic, which I was a massive fan of as

                                        </h3>
                                        <p class="paraformat">This television series focuses on telling us the life of
                                            the
                                            character, Andor. A Rebel fighter that we were introduced to in the
                                            successful
                                            Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.
                                            The show plans to establish more of a back story for Andor, as what we
                                            received
                                            in Rogue One was quite limited. The reason that I am so excited for this
                                            series
                                            is that before any footage
                                            or even any trailers, it already got confirmed to have a second season,
                                            meaning
                                            that the writers must have incredible faith in the show.

                                            focuses on a fleet of starfighter pilots flying across the
                                            galaxy completing a variety of missions that will help protect the lives of
                                            the
                                            innocent. This film is currently being directed
                                            by Patty Jenkins and is still in pre-production. I am quite excited for this
                                            project because nothing is as cool as epic space battles in
                                            Star Wars.</p>

                                <p class="paraformat">I remember hearing rumors about a possible Obi-Wan Kenobi movie or
                                    tv
                                    show and I couldn't
                                    even begin to imagine what they could do with it. Now that it's officially happening
                                    and
                                    the show is
                                    releasing May 2022, I've never been more excited then now, and we don't even know
                                    what
                                    the show
                                    is going to be about! All that is confirmed at the moment of writting this is that
                                    Hayden Christenson
                                    is returning to portray Darth Vader and Ray park is going to return as Darth maul!
                                    We
                                    have seen 2 renditions
                                    of Darth Maul so far, the one from the prequels and the one from the Clone Wars TV
                                    show.
                                    So I'm
                                    very excited to see how angry this version is compared to the two as well as how
                                    angry
                                    Darth Vader will
                                    be. Ewan Mcgregor did make a statement recently saying that Vader is scarier than
                                    what
                                    we saw in Rogue One,
                                    and if you saw that movie, he was pretty mencaing.

                                <p class="paraformat">Although not actually confirmed, I'm very hopeful EA will make a
                                    sequel to Jedi: Fallen
                                    Order. It was the best selling Star Wars game of the newer generation and has a die
                                    hard
                                    community followign it.
                                    The game became so popular Star Wars began selling Official Cal Kestis lightsabers
                                    in
                                    Star Wars land
                                    at Disney parks. Not only do I hope to see a second game for the series but I would
                                    also
                                    love to see
                                    Cal Kestis in a live action role. Considering the person who plays Cal, Cameron
                                    Monaghen, is an actual
                                    actor who has been on hit shows like Shameless, I'm hopeful that it's an actual
                                    possibility.

                                <p class="paraformat">I'm pretty excited for this movie mostly because I'm interested to
                                    see
                                    what
                                    Patty Jenkins is going to do with it. I was a fan of the first Wonder Woman movie,
                                    second one is
                                    a different story, so I'm excited to see how she puts a personal touch to it. I'm
                                    not to
                                    familiar
                                    with the Rogue Squadron comics and books, but it's a whole movie about fighter
                                    pilots,
                                    so what more
                                    can you need. I always found the fighter pilot scenes in Star Wars to be the best.
                                    The
                                    trench run
                                    scene in the original movie is so well done for what they had at the time, and the
                                    newer
                                    pilot scenes
                                    just keep getting better. </p>
