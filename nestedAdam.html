                                    <p class="paraformat">Eclipse is MMORPG styled video game that is developed by Quantic Dream and allows for players to express the story in a variety of narratives based on the player's actions. The timeline
                                        for this project shows that it takes place during the High Republic era and will also allow for players to interact on a variety of planets, but also within outer space. This game
                                        reminds me of Knights of the Old Republic, which I was a massive fan of as it expanded upon the lore of the Star Wars universe.

                                    <p class="paraformat">This television series focuses on telling us the life of the character, Andor. A Rebel fighter that we were introduced to in the successful Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.
                                        The show plans to establish more of a back story for Andor, as what we received in Rogue One was quite limited. The reason that I am so excited for this series is that before any footage 
                                        or even any trailers, it already got confirmed to have a second season, meaning that the writers must have incredible faith in the show.

                                    <p class="paraformat">Taking inspiration from the Star Wars: Visions episode of the same name, this novel focuses on establishing the lore behind

                                        was quite intriguing with its storytelling and use of the Star Wars universe.

                                        When it comes to acclaimed Star Wars games, you'll hear Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic's name mentioned more than just about anything else. A full remake is currently in the works from port specialist Aspyr, and it's headed to both PS5 and PC. EA's separate Star Wars: The Old Republic MMO is ongoing, but Knights of the Old Republic's story-focused single-player RPG style was riveting nearly two decades ago and should stand the test of time when the remake is ready to launch.

                                        Announced as EA's exclusivity period for the Star Wars franchise came to an end, Ubisoft's "The Star Wars Project," as it's currently known, is in development at Massive Entertainment--the same studio behind The Division and its sequel. Like those games, this Star Wars game will make use of the Snowdrop engine and will be set in an open world with a focus on narrative. Given that we have seen nothing of the game yet, it remains to be seen when it will actually release.

                        <p class="paraformat">I've been excited for this game for so long. It was originally announced in 2019 and slated to
                            release mid 2021 but got delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic but is officaily releasing April 2022!
                            This game remasters the classic Star Wars games I played as a child with up to date graphics as well
                            as adding campaigns for the newer trilogy that released (7-9). It is the first open world Lego game
                            that allows you to travel to different planets completing story missions that took place on said planet. As
                            well as bringing back all the classic playable characters, they'll be adding the newer franchises to the game
                            including Mando in his Beskar armor, classic character skins from the original games, and more.

                        <p class="paraformat">I remember hearing rumors about a possible Obi-Wan Kenobi movie or tv show and I couldn't
                            even begin to imagine what they could do with it. Now that it's officially happening and the show is 
                            releasing May 2022, I've never been more excited then now, and we don't even know what the show
                            is going to be about! All that is confirmed at the moment of writting this is that Hayden Christenson 
                            is returning to portray Darth Vader and Ray park is going to return as Darth maul! We have seen 2 renditions
                            of Darth Maul so far, the one from the prequels and the one from the Clone Wars TV show. So I'm
                            very excited to see how angry this version is compared to the two as well as how angry Darth Vader will
                            be. Ewan Mcgregor did make a statement recently saying that Vader is scarier than what we saw in Rogue One,
                            and if you saw that movie, he was pretty mencaing.
