                                <p class="paraformat">Star Wars: Clone Wars was a TV showed that premiered on
                                    the channel Disney XD. The story took place in-between Episode II and III
                                    and follows jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and his padiwan
                                    Ahsoka Tano. We follow the adventures of these 3 as they try and stop Emperial
                                    invasions of Droids on Rebel planets. Along the way we see Anakin's struggle
                                    when balancing the ligh and dark side of the force that is continued through

                                <p class="paraformat">The Clone Wars was seen as a revolutionary animation because
                                    at that point, not many shows were given a cinematic budget on their level. The
                                    initial series stopped airing after 6 seasons from 2008-2014 until the 7th seasons
                                    aired on Disney+ in 2020. The show became so popular that the characters Bo Katan
                                    and Ahsoka Tano were written into the live action shows Mandalorian and The Book
                                    of Boba Fett.

                                <p class="paraformat">The Bad Batch takes place right after the events of Order 66, in
                                    Episode III. Throughout this series,
                                    we are witness to the elite group of clone troopers known as Clone Force 99, a
                                    platoon
                                    that is best known for its uniqueness
                                    to other clones. This unit of troopers fight through daring missions as they have
                                    disobeyed the direct orders to overthrow the
                                    Galactic Republic.

                                <p class="paraformat">I feel that this show is the perfect follow-up to the event of
                                    Star
                                    Wars: The Clone Wars and Episode III as it
                                    puts us in the eyes of clone troopers who were able to disobey direct orders and
                                    separate themselves from the other mindless clones
                                    who followed. I also appreciate how this show can demonstrate how each character has
                                    rightfully earned their spot on the team
                                    as they all possess unique skills. I also find that the animation can superceed what
                                    was
                                    done in the Clone Wars and make it even more
                                    visually appealing.

                                <p class="paraformat">Have you wondered how Han Solo met Chewbacca? Or the history
                                    between
                                    Han Solo and Lando Calrissian and how he won the Millennium Falcon in a card game?
                                    Well Solo: A Star Wars Story can answer all of those questions and more by taking a
                                    young Han Solo through an adventure of betrayal and his witty intuition. In this
                                    film,
                                    you'll see Han Solo perform a variety of feats such as partaking in a heist with a
                                    smuggler crew and fighting against the crime syndicate known as the Crimson Dawn.

                                <p class="paraformat">This Star Wars story can separate itself from others as it can
                                    shine
                                    more of a light on the background of the scoundrel known as Han Solo. The film is
                                    viewed
                                    as one of the
                                    weaker installments in the Star Wars cinematic universe, as it primarily thrives on
                                    nostalgic feelings
                                    and answering questions that make Han Solo who he is. This included the iconic card
                                    game
                                    with Lando that won
                                    him the Millennium Falcon and also how Han met Chewie. I feel that this movie
                                    would've
                                    been better received if it has tackled a more well-known Han Solo story
                                    or even taken place after the events of Return of the Jedi.

                                    which we saw clones turn against the Jedi Order, and the Republic fell and turned

                                    the Empire.

                                    a variety of covert operations.

                                    I appreciate how this series can tie together a lot of concepts from the Republic

                                    the Rebellion Era, while also mending some frustrating plot holes. This series also
                                    does
                                    an amazing job in bringing back older
