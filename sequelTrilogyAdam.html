                    <p class="paraformat">In this series, the Avengers are reinvented to follow suede with the new 50-States Initiative, which was created after the iconic battle between heroes, better known as Civil War. This team is now led by both Ms. Marvel and Iron Man and includes fellow heroes such as Ares, Sentry, Black Widow, and more. This team's purpose was to act as the protectors of New York and battle any villains that would threaten innocent citizens.</p>
                    <p class="paraformat">This iteration of the Mighty Avengers was created by Brian Micheal Bendis and drawn by a collection of sketch artists. When looking at this series as a whole, I appreciate all that it does in expanding the lore of the Marvel Universe. I also enjoy how this series utilizes lesser-known characters and turns them into fan favorites. Overall, this series is quite strong in its writing as it calls back to other Avenger series in the past. My only complaint with this iteration is how the artists are consistently switched out with new people. This takes away from the immersion of the story, making it difficult to feel connected with said characters.</p>
