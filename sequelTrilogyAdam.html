                                <p class="paraformat">The Mandalorian takes place 5 years after the fall of the Galactic
                                    Empire and follows fellow bounty hunter, Din Djarin,
                                    who completes a variety of quests across the galaxy. The main premise of the show
                                    focuses on Din following one bounty that has him retrieve a child known
                                    as Grogu. After interacting with Grogu, Din goes against the bounty and decides to
                                    protect the child from other hunters and fighters of the remaining
                                    Imperial army. Throughout the fights and brawls with other characters in the Star
                                    Wars
                                    universe, Din Djarin realizes that protecting the child is the way.</p>
                                <p class="paraformat">This TV series is the most popular exclusive that the Disney+
                                    streaming service has and is the very first live-action Star Wars television
                                    adaptation.
                                    Throughout this series, there are a lot of thematic elements that are reminiscent of
                                    that of the class Western, with the Mandolarion being the rough and tough cowboy.
                                    In this unique story, we run into a variety of characters that are new to audiences
                                    and
                                    some that audiences have seen in previous media. With the first two seasons of
                                    the show being wildly successful, another season is on the way.

                                    also helps to wrap up the
                                    new trilogy that was introduced back in 2015. This film continues a year after the
                                    previous episode, The Last
                                    Jedi, and shows the Resistance continuing their plans to overthrow Supreme Leader
                                    Kylo
                                    Ren and bring order back
                                    to the galaxy. Within this movie, Emperor Palpatine is also somehow back and the
                                    Resistance will also have to face
                                    an overwhelming Imperial armada.
