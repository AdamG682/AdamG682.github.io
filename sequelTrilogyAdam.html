                                    Empire and follows fellow bounty hunter, Din Djarin, who completes a variety of
                                    quests across the galaxy. The main premise of the show focuses on Din following
                                    one bounty that has him retrieve a child known as Grogu. After interacting with
                                    Grogu, Din goes against the bounty and decides to protect the child from other
                                    hunters and fighters of the remaining Imperial army.

                                    This TV series is the most popular exclusive that the Disney+
                                    streaming service has and is the very first live-action Star Wars television
                                    adaptation. Throughout this series, there are a lot of thematic elements that are
                                    reminiscent of that of the class Western, with the Mandolarion being the rough and
                                    tough cowboy. In this unique story, we run into a variety of characters that are new

                                    in previous media.

                                    after falling into the Sarlac Pit back in Return of the Jedi. Throughout this
                                    show, we learn that Fett had established a bond with the Tusken Raiders and had even
                                    joined their tribe. Now after returning to Tatooine, Boba Fett takes the throne of
                                    former leader Jabba the Hutt and works with Fennec
                                    Shard to rule the criminal underground not with fear, but respect.

                                    uses a variety of well-known directors and writers to continue the story of the
                                    infamous bounty hunter. This show revisits the main character, by having a variety
                                    of flashbacks to his life as a Tusken Raider, while also highlighting his new role
                                    as the big boss of Tatooine.

                                    Resistance's fighters, Finn and Poe Dameron, as they work together to complete a

                                    back characters such as Han Solo and Leia Organa to establish the connection to
                                    previous trilogies. Episode VII can tackle themes that deal with standing up for the

                                <p class="font-weight-light text-center text-white px-4">The Last Jedi is the second film within the newly established
                                    sequel trilogy of the Skywalker saga and takes place right after the events of The
                                    Force Awakens. This film focuses on telling two stories at once, one focusing
                                    on the Resistance fighting against the attacks of the First Order and the other
                                    following Rey as she is trying to learn the ways of the Jedi from former Jedi Master
                                    Luke Skywalker.

                                    This film, similar to the last installment, in providing a lot of
                                    nostalgia for fans both new and old, while also providing a brand new Star Wars
                                    story to stand out from the others. Episode VIII is recognized as the weakest
                                    of the new trilogy due to confusing plot holes but is still capable of providing
                                    fans with that classic Star Wars formula.

                                    and also helps to wrap up the new trilogy that was introduced back in 2015. This
                                    film continues a year after the previous episode, The Last Jedi, and shows
                                    the Resistance continuing their plans to overthrow Supreme Leader Kylo Ren and bring
                                    order back to the galaxy. Within this movie, Emperor Palpatine is also somehow back
                                    and the Resistance will also have to face an overwhelming
                                    Imperial armada.

                                    In this film, we see a variety of new and old characters from past
                                    iterations of the Skywalker Saga work together for the greater good. This film is
                                    filled with action and plot twists to tell a story of understanding oneself
                                    and never giving up, even when the odds are against you.</p>
