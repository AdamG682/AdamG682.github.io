                                    Cal Kestis is my favorite character because of the journey that he went through. You can meet Cal Kestis by playing, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Oder, a game made by Respawn under EA. You play Cal and journey with your companion BD-1, a droid you find on the
                                    planet of Bogano. If you keep up with Star Wars you can see this droid in action during Boba Fett S1 EP5. Cal is a Jedi who had survived the elusive Order 66, executed by the Sith in conjunction with the clones. Roughly
                                    5 years after the events of Revenge of the Sith, you are a Jedi in hiding when you are discovered by a group of Sith lords. On the run you find a group of Rebel soldiers who you work with to track down an item that
                                    the new empire is looking for that could officially end the Jedi order.

                                    My second favorite character is BD-1, the droid from Jedi: Fallen Order. He is the equivalant of R2D2 to Luke, but do to his body, is able to show a lot more emotion. In the game, he has very fluid movement, not really seen in many drone companions. Throughout
                                    the game you can see BD-1 standing on Cal's shoulder like a parrot on a pirate. He has a built in hologram feature so he helps Cal get around various planets and terrain, he is equipped with a healing syringe compartment
                                    to help you when injured, and he just makes a really good friend. Like R2D2, he emotes a lot with various beeps, bops, and boops.

                                <p class="paraformat">I have been a Star Wars fan all of my life and have encapsulated myself with as much Star Wars media that I could take. One of my favorite games growing up was the original Star Wars Battlefront II on the very first Xbox.
                                    I remember playing that game for hours and hours on end, while also having the movies on repeat. I remember that I was a Star Wars character for Halloween five years in a row when I was a kid and my favorite costume
                                    was as Obi-Wan Kenobi.
                                </p>
                                <p class="paraformat">One of my favorite forms of media, which is outside of cinema, is the book titled "Kenobi" which is written by John Jackson Miller. The reason that this is one of my favorite Star Wars story arcs is that Obi-Wan has always
                                    been a fan favorite of mine and this story focuses on the aftermath of the events of Episode III. For those that are unaware, Obi-Wan was a witness to the self-destruction of the Republic through Order 66 and watched
                                    countless friends die. Also within that tragedy, he had to kill his brother, Anakin Skywalker. This story deals with a lot of serious topics such as PTSD and being able to recover from such a devasting loss, which is
                                    completely unlike Star Wars. I am always a fan of when popular series step outside of their comfort zone to try something new for fans.
                                </p>
                                <p class="paraformat">When trying to narrow down who my favorite Star Wars character is, it's like asking me what my favorite movie is, it's so hard to just choose one. If I had to pick one though, I think I would have to go with Captain Rex,
                                    who was first introduced in the animated Clone Wars series. I believe that the reason he is one of my favorites is that he fought against Order 66, once his programming chip was removed because he understood that what
                                    was being done was immoral and treason. I am also glad to see him return in other iterations, such as Star Wars: Rebels, where we see him once again fight for the greater good.
