                            <p class="paraformat">Although Kal Kestis is not apart of the Star Wars cinematic Universe,
                                He is my favorite character because of the journey that he went through. You can meet Cal
                                Kestis by playing, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Oder, a game made by Respawn under EA. You play
                                Cal and journey with your companion BD-1, a droid you find on the planet of Bogano. If you 
                                keep up with Star Wars you can see this droid in action during Boba Fett S1 EP5.
                                Cal is a Jedi who had survived the elusive Order 66, executed by the Sith in 
                                conjunction with the clones. Roughly 5 years after the events of Revenge of the Sith, you are a 
                                Jedi in hiding when you are discovered by a group of Sith lords. On the run you find a group of Rebel
                                soldiers who you work with to take down the new group of Sith to stop the spread of the Empire.

                        <p class="paraformat">I have been a Star Wars fan all of my life and have encapsulated myself with as much Star Wars media that
                            I could take. One of my favorite games growing up was the original Star Wars Battlefront 2 on the very first Xbox. I remember
                            playing that game for hours and hours on end, while also having the movies on repeat. I remember that I was a Star Wars character
                            for Halloween five years in a row when I was a kid and my favorite costume was as Obi-Wan Kenobi.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paraformat">One of my favorite forms of media, which is outside of cinema, is the book titled "Kenobi" which is written
                            by John Jackson Miller. The reason that this is one of my favorite Star Wars story arcs is that Obi-Wan has always been a fan
                            favorite of mine and this story focuses on the aftermath of the events of Episode III. For those that are unaware, Obi-Wan was
                            a witness to the self-destruction of the Republic through Order 66 and watched countless friends die. Also within that tragedy,
                            he had to kill his brother, Anakin Skywalker. This story deals with a lot of serious topics such as PTSD and being able to recover
                            from such a devasting loss, which is completely unlike Star Wars. I am always a fan of when popular series step outside of their comfort
                            zone to try something new for fans.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paraformat">When trying to narrow down who my favorite Star Wars character is, it's like asking me what my favorite movie is, it's 
                            so hard to just choose one. If I had to pick one though, I think I would have to go with Captain Rex, who was first introduced in the animated
                            Clone Wars series. I believe that the reason he is one of my favorites is that he fought against Order 66, once his programming chip was removed
                            because he understood that what was being done was immoral and treason. I am also glad to see him return in other iterations, such as Star Wars: Rebels, 
                            where we see him once again fight for the greater good.

                            <p class="paraformat">Anakin Skywalker was a legendary Force-sensitive human male who was a Jedi Knight of the Galactic Republic and the prophesied Chosen One of the Jedi Order, destined to bring balance to the Force. Also known as "Ani" during his childhood, Skywalker earned the moniker "Hero With No Fear" from his accomplishments in the Clone Wars. His alter ego, Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith, was created when Skywalker turned to the dark side of the Force, pledging his allegiance to the Sith Lord Darth Sidious at the end of the Republic Era.</p>
