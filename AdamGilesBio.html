                                    Growing up my dad
                                    
                                    The Mandalorian takes place 5 years after the fall of the Galactic
                                    Empire and follows fellow bounty hunter, Din Djarin,
                                    who completes a variety of quests across the galaxy. The main premise of the show
                                    focuses on Din following one bounty that has him retrieve a child known
                                    as Grogu. After interacting with Grogu, Din goes against the bounty and decides to
                                    protect the child from other hunters and fighters of the remaining
                                    Imperial army. Throughout the fights and brawls with other characters in the Star
                                    Wars universe, Din Djarin realizes that protecting the child is the way.</p>

                                    This is my second year within the GIMM program at Boise State University and I have
                                    learned so much in my time here. I have learned a variety of coding languages such as
                                    HTML, JS, C#, and much more. I have also met some amazing people that I am proud to
                                    work.

                                    For fun, I like to hike, draw, and hang out with friends. In regards to the more nerdy
                                    stuff, I am big on collecting figures and comic books while also being a huge gamer. I
                                    am currently playing through the Batman Arkham series again in anticipation of the new
                                    Batman movie. I also enjoy playing other games like Apex Legends, CS:GO, and Call of Duty, 
                                    especially the Zombies game mode. My name Steam name is <a
