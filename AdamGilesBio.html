                                    Growing up my first introduction to the superhero and science fiction genre was
                                    by my Dad when he gave me some of his X-Men comic books to read for fun. Ever since
                                    then
                                    I have been invested in almost everything that revolves around superheroes and science
                                    fiction.
                                    I have lived in Oregon for the majority of my life, but I have also lived in other
                                    places such
                                    as Virgina, North Carolina, Florida, and even Puerto Rico.</p>

                                    This is my second year within the GIMM program at Boise State University and I have
                                    learned so much in my time here. I have learned a variety of coding languages such
                                    as
                                    HTML, JS, C#, and much more. I have also met some amazing people that I am proud to
                                    work.
                                </p>

                                    For fun, I like to hike, draw, and hang out with friends. In regards to the more

                                    stuff, I am big on collecting figures and comic books while also being a huge gamer.
                                    I
                                    am currently playing through the Batman Arkham series again in anticipation of the

                                    Batman movie. I also enjoy playing other games like Apex Legends, CS:GO, and Call of
                                    Duty,
                                    especially the Zombies game mode. My name Steam name is below, so feel free to
