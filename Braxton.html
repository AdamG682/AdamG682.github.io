                                From Lucasfilm comes the first of the Star Wars standalone films, "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," an all-new epic adventure. In a time of conflict, a group of unlikely heroes band together on a mission to steal the plans to the Death Star, the Empire's ultimate weapon of destruction. This key event in the Star Wars timeline brings together ordinary people who choose to do extraordinary things, and in doing so, become part of something greater than themselves.

                                Approximately six years after the formation of the Galactic Empire, Imperial Director Orson Krennic and a squad of his death troopers land on the planet Lah'mu and forcibly recruit scientist Galen Erso to complete the work of the Death Star, a space station capable of destroying entire planets. Galen's wife, Lyra Erso, is killed when she shoots and injures Krennic to stop him from taking her husband. Their daughter, Jyn Erso, goes into hiding until Saw Gerrera, leader of the Partisans, rescues her and takes her in.

Jerjerrod argues that they need more men, but quickly agrees to double their efforts when he learns that the Emperor is coming.
