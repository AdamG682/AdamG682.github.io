                                    The evil lord Darth Vader,
                                    obsessed with finding young
                                    Skywalker, has dispatched
                                    thousands of remote probes into
                                    the far reaches of space....

                                    It is now three years after the events of A New Hope. The Rebel Alliance has been
                                    forced
                                    to flee its base on Yavin 4 and establish a new one on the ice planet of Hoth.

                                    An Imperial Star Destroyer, dispatched by the Sith Lord Darth Vader, continuing his
                                    quest for Luke Skywalker, launches thousands of probe droids across the galaxy, one
                                    of
                                    which lands on Hoth and begins its survey of the planet. Luke Skywalker, on patrol
                                    astride his tauntaun, discovers the probe, which he mistakes for a meteorite. After
                                    reporting to comrade Han Solo that he'll investigate the site, Luke is knocked
                                    unconscious by a deadly wampa.
