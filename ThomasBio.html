                                    I grew up in Southern California and my dad always pushed nerd culture onto us. We grew up watching Lord of the Rings, read the hobbit when we were young, and of course, watched a lot of Star Wars. We had a <a class="paragraphLinks"

                                    my dad was a huge fan. He first took my brother to see the Phantom Menace in theater when we was 4 years old. It wasn't until I was 14 that he took me to see The Force Awakens in theater. Growing up in Southern California
                                    we had Disneyland annual passes for most of my childhood and the first ride we would always do was Star Tours. We were super excited when Star Wars Land opened up and went there as often as we could. On one of those

                                    Now, I'm currently a GIMM student at BSU, doing homeworking and also doing a lot of gaming. At the moment I'm playing a lot of Apex Legends as well as Lost Ark which I did not expect to like so much. As of writting, Elden ring is 22 hours away from launch
                                    after years so I'll probably playing that as well. Games I would reccomend everyone to play is the Ori series, Portal series, Half Life series, Death Stranding, The Outer Worlds, and Guardians of the Galaxy. In terms
                                    of FPS games Rainbow Six Siege, Apex, and Valorant are all very solid.
