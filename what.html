                                    Star Wars is an American epic space opera multimedia franchise created by George
                                    Lucas,
                                    which began with the eponymous 1977 film and quickly became a worldwide pop-culture
                                    phenomenon. The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media,
                                    including television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park
                                    attractions,
                                    and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe. In 2020, its
                                    total
                                    value was estimated at US$70 billion, and it is currently the fifth-highest-grossing
                                    media franchise of all time.

                                    The original film (Star Wars), retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope
                                    (1977),
                                    was followed by the sequels Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode
                                    VI:
                                    Return of the Jedi (1983), forming the original Star Wars trilogy. Lucas later
                                    returned
                                    to the series to direct a prequel trilogy, consisting of Episode I: The Phantom
                                    Menace
                                    (1999), Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III: Revenge of the
                                    Sith
                                    (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney, relinquishing his
                                    ownership of the franchise. This led to a sequel trilogy, consisting of Episode VII:
                                    The
                                    Force Awakens (2015), Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: The Rise
                                    of
                                    Skywalker (2019).

                                    All nine films of the "Skywalker saga" were nominated for Academy Awards, with wins
                                    going to the first two releases. Together with the theatrical live action
                                    "anthology"
                                    films Rogue One (2016) and Solo (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films
                                    equated to over US$10 billion, which makes it the second-highest-grossing film
                                    franchise
                                    of all time. An additional film, Rogue Squadron, is planned for release. A number of
                                    other films, including an independent trilogy, are suggested to be in development.

                                    To me Star Wars was a franchise that no matter who and how old you are, it's
                                    okay to be a child sometimes. The Star Wars movie I had seen in theaters was Episode
                                    7. I went with my dad and brother and the sheer excitement I had seen on their faces
                                    brought so much joy to me. To hear the Star Wars theme blast on the theater speakers
                                    was
                                    so amazing, and I don't think anything could beat that for me. Star Wars has made
                                    it's
                                    way
                                    into almost every form of media. From the movies, TV show, merchandising, even food,
                                    it's
                                    almost impossible to escape it.

                                    Star Wars to me was about the infinite possibilities that could happen and no matter
                                    who you are you can be special. Which made my child mind blow up with imagination
                                    and wonder. The first time I watched Star Wars in the theatre was when the movie
                                    theatres were doing a star wars special and were playing all six movies in one day.
                                    I remember that day I went in to the movie theatre and didnt leave till like 1 in
                                    the morning. After that I studied star wars I bought all the books and comics I
                                    could so I could be the biggest fan.

                            <p title="Explanation of the Force" class="paraformat">To me, Star Wars is a classic
                                tale
                                between
                                good and evil. We see that throughout thousands and thousands of years,
                                there are always villains, but we also see that there are always heroes to stand up
                                and
                                fight against injustice. I find that if I
                                lived within the Star Wars universe, I would lean more to the light side of the
                                Force as I
                                am always wanting to fight for the underdog
                                and help those that are around me. I also enjoy how the concept of the Force is so
                                central
                                to the Star Wars universe, but it is something
                                so simple. The Force is primarily an energy source that requires the user to have a
                                clear
                                understanding of themselves, while also having a mental
                                balance. You can read more about the Force <a

                            <p title="Webpages I Am Proud Of" class="paraformat">The first HTML webpage that I
                                worked on was
                                the <a href=index.html style="color: steelblue; font-weight: bolder;">
                                    INDEX.HTML</a>. For
                                this webpage,
                                the primary focus was to create a functioning navigation bar that allows the user to
                                jump
                                from webpage to webpage easily.
                                After creating the navbar, I was stuck with an empty page and was unsure as to what
                                to add,
                                but after learning about animations within
                                CSS, I decided that would be the perfect thing. I had never created animations
                                within CSS
                                before and for this being my first time, I would
                                say that I didn't do too bad as all it entailed was changing the perspective of the
                                text. If
                                I could change one thing it would be to allow for
                                the text crawl to mobile responsive rather than creating a horizontal scrollbar in
                                mobile
                                view.

                            <p title="Webpages I Am Proud Of" class="paraformat">Another HTML webpage that I worked
                                on was
                                the <a href=nestedAdam.html
                                    style="color: steelblue; font-weight: bolder;">NESTED.HTML</a>.
                                For this webpage,
                                the primary focus was to create a dynamically designed webpage that allowed for my
                                team and
                                me to create 5 layer nested tags. After
                                establishing the layout of the page it was easy to work through the kinks and create
                                a
                                personalized webpage that uses a variety of div tags
                                and other tags nested inside one another. I had done something like this before in
                                previous
                                classes, but I was pleased with how the final
                                layout turned out with all the information. I think something I would fix is
                                figuring out
                                how to change the height of the iframe YouTube video. My team
                                and I were able to figure out how to make the video mobile responsive, but couldn't
                                figure
                                out how to get it out of this squished window.
