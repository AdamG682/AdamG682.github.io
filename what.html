                                    Star Wars is an American epic space opera multimedia franchise created by George Lucas, which began with the eponymous 1977 film and quickly became a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon. The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media,
                                    including television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe. In 2020, its total value was estimated at US$70 billion, and
                                    it is currently the fifth-highest-grossing media franchise of all time. The original film (Star Wars), retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope (1977), was followed by the sequels Episode V: The Empire Strikes
                                    Back (1980) and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983), forming the original Star Wars trilogy. Lucas later returned to the series to direct a prequel trilogy, consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode
                                    II: Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. This led to a sequel trilogy, consisting
                                    of Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015), Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019). All nine films of the "Skywalker saga" were nominated for Academy Awards, with wins going to
                                    the first two releases. Together with the theatrical live action "anthology" films Rogue One (2016) and Solo (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equated to over US$10 billion, which makes it the second-highest-grossing
                                    film franchise of all time. An additional film, Rogue Squadron, is planned for release. A number of other films, including an independent trilogy, are suggested to be in development.

                                    To me Star Wars was a franchise that no matter who and how old you are, it's okay to be a child sometimes. The Star Wars movie I had seen in theaters was Episode 7. I went with my dad and brother and the sheer excitement I had seen on their faces brought
                                    so much joy to me. To hear the Star Wars theme blast on the theater speakers was so amazing, and I don't think anything could beat that for me. Star Wars has made it's way into almost every form of media. From the movies,
                                    TV show, merchandising, even food, it's almost impossible to escape it.

                                    Star Wars to me was about the infinite possibilities that could happen and no matter who you are you can be special. Which made my child mind blow up with imagination and wonder. The first time I watched Star Wars in the theatre was when the movie theatres
                                    were doing a star wars special and were playing all six movies in one day. I remember that day I went in to the movie theatre and didnt leave till like 1 in the morning. After that I studied star wars I bought all the
                                    books and comics I could so I could be the biggest fan.

We see that throughout thousands and thousands of years, there are always villains, but we also see that there are always heroes to stand up and fight against injustice.
                                I find that if I lived within the Star Wars universe, I would lean more to the light side of the Force as I am always wanting to fight for the underdog and help those that are around me. I also enjoy how the concept of
                                the Force is so central to the Star Wars universe, but it is something so simple. The Force is primarily an energy source that requires the user to have a clear understanding of themselves, while also having a mental balance.

                                was unsure as to what to add, but after learning about animations within CSS, I decided that would be the perfect thing. I had never created animations within CSS before and for this being my first time, I would say that
                                I didn't do too bad as all it entailed was changing the perspective of the text. If I could change one thing it would be to allow for the text crawl to mobile responsive rather than creating a horizontal scrollbar in mobile
                                view.

                                to create 5 layer nested tags. After establishing the layout of the page it was easy to work through the kinks and create a personalized webpage that uses a variety of div tags and other tags nested inside one another.
                                I had done something like this before in previous classes, but I was pleased with how the final layout turned out with all the information. I think something I would fix is figuring out how to change the height of the iframe
                                YouTube video. My team and I were able to figure out how to make the video mobile responsive, but couldn't figure out how to get it out of this squished window.
